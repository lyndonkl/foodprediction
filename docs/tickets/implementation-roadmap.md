# Implementation Roadmap: Food Metabolomics Graph Learning

## Overview
This roadmap organizes the implementation into logical phases for a personal project focused on three core objectives: food origin prediction, salient molecule discovery, and nutrition-aware embeddings. Each phase builds upon the previous one with a modular approach.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Tickets 00-02)
**Goal**: Establish the project foundation and data processing pipeline

### Ticket 00: Project Setup
- **Focus**: Environment, structure, and basic configuration for heterogeneous graph learning

### Ticket 01: Data Processing  
- **Focus**: dreaMS integration for molecule embeddings and nutritional data processing

### Ticket 02: Graph Construction
- **Focus**: Heterogeneous graph creation with Molecules, Foods, Samples, and Nutrients

**Phase 1 Deliverables**:
- Complete project structure and environment
- Data processing pipeline with dreaMS integration
- Functional heterogeneous graph construction
- Ready for model development

## Phase 2: Model Development (Tickets 03-05)
**Goal**: Implement the core GNN model and training pipelines

### Ticket 03: Basic GNN Model
- **Focus**: Heterogeneous GAT architecture with attention for interpretability

### Ticket 04: GraphCL Pretraining
- **Focus**: Self-supervised learning with contrastive learning for generalizable representations

### Ticket 05: Multi-Task Fine-Tuning
- **Focus**: Multi-task learning for food classification, molecule discovery, and nutrition alignment

**Phase 2 Deliverables**:
- Complete GNN model architecture with attention
- Self-supervised pretraining pipeline
- Multi-task fine-tuning system for all three objectives
- Working training and validation workflows

## Phase 3: Evaluation & Inference (Tickets 06-07)
**Goal**: Comprehensive evaluation and inference capabilities

### Ticket 06: Evaluation Metrics
- **Focus**: Comprehensive evaluation for all three objectives

### Ticket 07: Inference Pipeline
- **Focus**: Inference for the three objectives

**Phase 3 Deliverables**:
- Complete evaluation framework for all objectives
- Inference pipeline for food prediction, molecule discovery, and nutrition analysis
- Dynamic graph update capabilities
- Real-time processing for new data

## Implementation Strategy

### Core Objectives Focus
- **Food Origin Prediction**: Identify the origin food of unknown MS/MS spectrum samples
- **Salient Molecule Discovery**: Identify the most chemically informative molecules for classification
- **Nutrition-Aware Embeddings**: Learn embeddings of food types that reflect nutritional similarity

### Key Technical Components
- **Heterogeneous Graph**: Molecules, Foods, Samples, Nutrients with dreaMS embeddings
- **GraphCL Pretraining**: Self-supervised learning with graph augmentations
- **Multi-Task Learning**: Three objectives with attention-based interpretability
- **Dynamic Inference**: Real-time processing of new metabolomics data

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Data Dependencies**: Start with dummy data for early development
2. **Model Complexity**: Begin with simple GAT, add complexity incrementally
3. **Performance**: Profile early and optimize bottlenecks
4. **Integration**: Test integration points frequently

### Success Criteria
- **Phase 1**: Can construct and validate heterogeneous graph
- **Phase 2**: Can train model end-to-end for all three objectives
- **Phase 3**: Can evaluate and deploy for all objectives

## Next Steps
1. Start with **Ticket 00: Project Setup**
2. Validate each ticket completion before moving to the next
3. Focus on the three core objectives throughout development
4. Maintain documentation and reproducibility
5. Regular validation of functionality

## Notes for Implementation
- Focus on **modularity** and **clean interfaces** for the three objectives
- Ensure **reproducibility** at every step
- Maintain **comprehensive logging** and **error handling**
- Consider **memory efficiency** for large metabolomics datasets
- Prioritize **interpretability** for salient molecule discovery
- Keep **personal project scope** in mind - avoid enterprise complexity
