# Ticket 07: Inference Pipeline

## Phase: Deployment
**Estimated Time**: 3-5 hours  
**Dependencies**: Ticket 06

## Description
Implement inference pipeline for deploying the trained model to make predictions on new data and generate insights for the three core objectives: food origin prediction, salient molecule discovery, and nutrition-aware embeddings.

## Context from Implementation Plan
- **Dynamic Graph Updates**: Single large graph with dynamic node/edge additions at inference time
- **Inference Tasks**: Food origin prediction, salient molecule identification, nutrition-aware embedding generation
- **Graph Structure**: Heterogeneous graph with Molecules, Foods, Samples, Nutrients
- **Model Outputs**: Classification probabilities, molecule importance scores, nutritional embeddings
- **Real-time Processing**: Handle new MS/MS samples and nutritional data
